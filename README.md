# Financial-Fraud-Detection-with-Isolation-Forest-XGBoost-and-Autoencoders
Fraud detection project using ML &amp; DL (Isolation Forest, XGBoost, Autoencoder) to identify fraudulent financial transactions.
In this project I have used a Fraud Detection on Paysim Dataset available on Kaggle and the link for the Dataset is provided over here "https://www.kaggle.com/code/kartik2112/fraud-detection-on-paysim-dataset/input"
I have also done a Exploratory Data Analysis on the Dataset to find out some more information on it
I have also used three different algorithms Isolation Forest (A Unsupervised Algorithm), XGBoost Algorithm (Supervised Algorithm), and AutoEncoders(Deep Learning)
Among these the XGBoost Alogrithm yields the best result then the AutoEncoder algorithm yeilds good result then comes the Isolation Forest Algorithm

Technologies used:
Jupyter Notebook, 

Pandas, NumPy (Data processing)

Scikit-learn, XGBoost (ML models)

TensorFlow/Keras (Autoencoders)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualizations)

This project demonstrates how machine learning and deep learning models can be leveraged for fraud detection. Among the tested approaches, XGBoost provided the highest accuracy and recall, making it suitable for real-world deployment, while Autoencoders showed promise in anomaly-based detection.
